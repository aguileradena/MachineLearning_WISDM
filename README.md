# MachineLearning_WISDM

## A machine learning exercise using the public datasest "WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activty and Biometrics Dataset"

In this repository you will find the files I created to use Machine Learning algorithms on the WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activty and Biometrics Dataset. The data set is public, and it can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WISDM+Smartphone+and+Smartwatch+Activity+and+Biometrics+Dataset+). 

The data and the data acquicition process are described by in detail by [Weiss (2019)](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00507/WISDM-dataset-description.pdf), but a summary can also be found in the [report](report.pdf). The dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope readings from smartphones and smartwatches, obtained while asking a sample of 51 users to perform a series of 18 different physical activities.

The analysis I perform on the dataset consists of a comparison between different ML classification techniques I tested, to figure out what activity the users are performing based on the readings from smartphone and smartwatch accelerometer and gyroscope readings. is I also provide here a [jupyter notebook](WISDM_dataset_analysis.ipynb) with the analysis and ML techniques I used in the dataset.

The report and data analysis are a work in progress, and I will update them in the coming weeks.
